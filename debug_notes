Set up the dashdisplay in the shed with a windows PC monitoring the batrium via usb, and the
toughbook running wireshark.


The windows PC running batrium tools showed
shunt V 64.22 to 64.25
Shunt I about -0.005A , from -4ma to -7mA. 
Vmin = 3.98
Vmax = 4.02
Tmin=5
Tmax=7
SOC = 100%   now, I set it to 70 so this is odd. Perhaps some calibrating going on??

The dashdisplay showed
shunt V 64.22 
Shunt I either -0 or some stupid big number, some of which crashed the display
Vmin = 3.980
Vmax = 4.20
Tmin=5
Tmax=7
SOC = 100%

Haflinger display I is just wrong, 
and max_cell_v is 4.20 not 4.020.
rest looks sane for now.

Now there seems to be a fractional digit missing on vmax, inspect the code there. Yep, obvious bug. Fixed.

The float is likely harder. Just checked all the message types, ShuntCurrent appears in 5 message types but always as floatle.

Lets have a look at the wireshark dump.. I captured 204 packets in 288 seconds.

john@magpie:/fs/john/projects/arduino/haflinger/dashdisplay/debug$ ./pack_summary packets.txt |sort | uniq -c
     29 3031      len=30
     28 3033      len=70
     28 3233      len=   documented in payload/js as LiveDisplay.js  
    115 5732      len=50 documented in pdf as System Discovery Info and in payload/js
      4 6831      len=   documented in pdf as Telemetry - Quick Session History and in paload/js

now shuntcurrent is at offset 44 decimal, which is 0020 + 0c hex.

./pack_summary_type_currentvals packets.txt|sort | uniq -c
gives me 77 different encodings. 
      
Checking IEEE representation..
bit 31 is sign. 1 == negative
bits [30 - 23] is exponent
bits [22 .. 0 ] is fraction.

there is a leading 1 ahead of the decimal point.

Suppose that we want to convert 9 97/128 into a IEEE 32 bit format. The process is:

1. Convert to base 2.
1001.1100001

2 . Shift number to the form of 1.FFFFFF Ã— 2E:
1.0011100001 x 2^3

3. Add 127 (excess 127 code) to exponent field and convert to binary:
3 + 127 = 130 = 10000010

4. Determine the sign bit. If a negative number, set to 1. Otherwise set to 0.

5. Now put the numbers together, using only the fractional part of the number represented by step 2 above (remove the 1. preceding the fractional part):

0 100000010 001110000100000000000
or in hex
411c2000

I saw -0.005 A

and I now think Batrium moves current in mA.
so thats -5
sign = 1
101
or 1.01 * 2^2
so exponent is 2 + 127 = 129 = 10000001

sign + exponent = C08
which is consistent with what I captured...

converting what I captured to bigendian and sorting, I see
c0915b27 .. c0e50e12
which is c08 and 00115b27  to 11050e12
