Some of the files here, and their issues.:


dd_3.FCStd
Is the original front , with a spigot.
It prints from the outside front face down.
I printed it with supports, so it takes quite a while to clean up.
Its generally too tight on the display in XY and tight on the display wiring board in Z. 
Worked for SW dev.

 - Currently these three parts are used.
 - about 7 hrs to print dd_front_nospigot.FCStd, 1 hr for the spigot, 4 hrs for dd3_back2.FCStd
   - on the mighty Creality ender3v2 that is. In PLA.


dd3_back2.FCStd
This is the original and so far only surround around the esp32. It goes over the spigot.
It prints spigot side down. This needed vigourous sanding with a dremel sandpaper drum to remove supports.
Otherwise it seems OK.
If I needed another one I'd redraw it with a taper around the waist so it prints in reverse (ie solid back on the bed) with no supports. 

dd_front_nospigot.FCStd
This is a redraw of dd_3.FCStd to add 0.5mm all around the display, and an extra mm of Z for both
display and wiring board.  Its designed to print with the rear (surface on dash) on the bed. No supports needed.
No spigot, just a groove to locate the spigot while its epoxied in. 
I also changed to heat formed stakes to hold down the display, which was a mistake. They missed position by a
few tenths of a mm,  and were too fragile to shave down. I just broke them off and will fit either self tappers or maybe a bit of filament to hold the displays in. Self tappers are on order.

dd_spigot.FCStd
The same spigot design used in the first one, without the front, and a pointy end to match the groove in dd_front_nospigot.FCStd
